    "The table is set with our fine china and a couple of wine glasses."

    "I went and bought a nice new burgundy tablecloth just for the occasion, and the white dishes contrast it nicely."

    "There is a cute silver candelabra in the center, set with four candles to be lit when I see Nate walking over from the bus stop."

    "I used to buy him flowers, but since he opened the flower shop they’ve lost their impact."

    "As I’m waiting, I’ve been working on our dinner."

    "I’ve just finished roasting the vegetables and am now sautéing the fish – a beautiful pair of tilapias."

    "There’s only so much time left to finish everything, and I need to make sure to get it all right."

    "I finish the tilapias off and plate them, then use a bit of sherry to deglaze the pan and make a flavorful, light sauce to pour over the finished dish."

    "I still manage to finish the dishes off with a garnish and get ready to light the candles."

    "Another minute of waiting, a smile plastered on my face."

    "I’ve finally gotten everything exactly how I want it."

    "It’s going to be perfect. Nate’s going to love it."

    "Tilapia is his favorite."

    "I barely get to cook for him anymore, and I made sure to have everything ready especially after the disaster of our not-lunch."

    "A third minute passes. He’s not here."

    "The tension is killing me. It’s not like I’ve ever counted the seconds between him getting off the bus and getting up here before."

    "But today is different. It’s our fifth wedding anniversary."

    "We’ve been together for about eight years altogether but we never really took our anniversary seriously until after the wedding."

    "..."

    "It’s been all of five minutes. I’m a bit worried."

    "My smile drops a bit and I walk toward the door."

    "I hear a bit of muffled talking in the hall, and a couple sets of footsteps approaching."

    na "{size=15}...and I know things have been rough, so I don’t mind at all.{/size}"

    ni "{size=16}I just don’t want to be a burden to you both, but if you’re sure…{/size}"

    na "{size=17}Nonsense. Just let me talk to him, he’ll understand.{/size}"

    ni "{size=18}Thank you. Should I… wait out here?{/size}"

    na "{size=19}Mmmmm… maybe not. It’s not like you two haven’t met before."

    "Nate is speaking to a person with a familiar voice."

    "I open the front door and see them standing at the door with several bags of luggage."

    "As I look toward the bags of luggage and back up to Nate, he gives me an apologetic expression."

    "I look to see the person standing next to Nate – his cousin, Nic."

    "Looking back to Nate, he puts on a smile."

    na "Happy anniversary… my love?"

    "I shake my head and sigh, chuckling."

    w "Happy anniversary."

    "I turn toward Nic."

    w "Hey, Nic. Moving in?"

    ni "H-hey. If it’s alright with you, yeah. I… broke up with Zephyr. He kicked me out."

    w "Woah, that’s great news!"

    "I feel a slap on my arm."

    na "Wolfrick! No, bad!"

    w "What? You didn’t like him either, we should be celebrating!"

    "Nic looks off to the side for a moment, and Nate pinches the bridge of his nose."

    "Nate puts a hand on Nic’s shoulder."

    na "We’ll just… be a moment."

    "Nic nods and Nate ushers me inside, closing the door."

    "He slaps my arm again."

    w "Ow! Quit it!"

    na "What is {i}wrong{/i} with you?! He’s dealing with a lot right now."

    w "S-sorry, I was just surprised by – and happy for – the news! That guy sucked, Nate!"

    na "Regardless of that, seriously? Please try to have {i}at least{/i} a modicum of tact, Wolfrick!"

    na "Sometimes, I swear you can’t hear yourself."

    "I sigh and nod, shrugging."

    w "Yeah, you’re right. I’ll be more considerate of his emotions."

    "Nate nods, and moves closer."

    na "Wolfrick, please just apologize to him and then let’s talk about him staying here for a bit?"

    "I nod and we move back over to the door."

    "Nate opens it and Nic is leaning against the wall across the hall."

    "I motion for Nate to move out of the way and step in front of Nic."

    "He sheepishly smiles, lifting his brows into a concerned expression."

    "I put my hand on his shoulder and look him in the eyes."

    w "Look, I’m sorry Nic. I know you’re hurting and that you have a lot of emotions to work through, and we’d be more than happy to have you here while you get back on your feet."

    w "We have a spare bedroom, and you’re welcome to it."

    ni "Oh, that’s… are you sure? I know this is sudden and I don’t want to step on your toes…"

    na "Nonsense, you’re family and you’re in need."

    "I smile at Nate and lift up as many of the bags of luggage as I can."

    "Nic is holding a bag, and Nate has another one. I am carrying the other three."

    "We move everything into the apartment and I lead Nic to the room."

    w "Here we are."

    na "We use it for extra storage."

    na "It’s only got a few boxes in the corner but there’s a twin bed and more than enough room."

    "I open the door, and lead the others inside. We leave Nic’s luggage on the far side of the room and I move back to the doorway."

    w "We have spare blankets and pillows inside one of those boxes, we can wash them if they’re too dusty."

    w "Just let us know!"

    na "Feel free to come get me if you need help unpacking, I’m just going to go talk with Wolfrick, okay Nic?"

    ni "Y-yes. Thank you both, this is great! I’ll just try to stay out of the way."

    na "Nonsense, you’re more than welcome! Just try to relax and process your feelings for now."

    "Nic nods and Nate nears the doorway."

    "He turns to smile at me and I smile back, as we head out into the living room."

    "Nate closes Nic’s door and we move to the opposite end of the room."

    w "So, want to explain what happened? How did this all come to fruition?"

    na "Well, I was closing up the flower shop…"

    w "Yeah?"

    na "...and then I saw Nic dragging his luggage over toward it from the bus stop…"

    na "He told me what he told you, about Zephyr."

    na "I asked him if he had a place to stay or if he was just booted out onto the streets."

    w "Go on…"

    na "He told me Zephyr wouldn’t let him get his portion of their money from the ATM with their card."

    na "Can you believe that?"

    "I scoff."

    w "What a scrub. I bet Nic’s ‘portion’ makes up a hundred percent of the money in that account."

    "Zephyr has never been well-received by anyone in Nic’s immediate family, and honestly for good reason."

    "Suddenly, Nate’s sniffing the air."

    na "Do you smell fish?"

    "Oh, yeah. I forgot all about the dinner."

    "I point over toward the romantic display sitting just fifteen feet away."

    w "I made dinner, I was going to surprise you with your favorite for our anniversary."

    na "O-oh. Wolfrick, that’s… so sweet."

    na "I’m so sorry, I didn’t even consider you might have done something like this and now…"

    w "It’s alright. I know it would be awkward and kind of rude to continue this while Nic is here."

    w "I’ll ditch the candles and re-portion it to three plates and offer some to him."

    na "I’m sorry again, and thank you, Wolfrick."

    "Nate leans in and kisses me on the cheek."
