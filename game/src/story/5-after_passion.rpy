    "While Nate and I have been eating it slowly here and there, Nic is in a hurry."

    "He has a meeting at an auto shop nearby for a job – one he apparently had to reschedule from the day before because of his situation."

    "Luckily for him, the owner of that auto shop is an old friend from the rebellion! He basically agreed immediately to hire him, and just needed to vet Nic’s skill level."

    "Nate has been cuddling with me and every time something he is interested in is mentioned on screen, he and I have been talking about it – with Nic giving input here and there."

    "Over the course of the news broadcast, there have been segments on the I-I population, local charity events and the typical conspiracy report regarding the former High Emperor King Rexford."

    "His gaze hardens a bit."

    voice "voice/5-after_passion/056.opus"

    voice "voice/5-after_passion/057.opus"

    "Nic smiles at Nate and I again."

    voice "voice/5-after_passion/058.opus"
    ni "...and when they can do the same for you – you become something worth so much to one another."

    voice "voice/5-after_passion/059.opus"

    voice "voice/5-after_passion/064.opus"

    voice "voice/5-after_passion/067.opus"
    ni "Hand it over."

    "Zephyr is…quivering?"

    voice "voice/5-after_passion/068.opus"
    z "H-here. It’s yours."

    voice "voice/5-after_passion/072.opus"

    "Nic thinks for a moment and then shrugs."

    voice "voice/5-after_passion/073.opus"

    voice "voice/5-after_passion/074.opus"
    ni "Oh! Anyway, I’ve gotta finish getting ready~"

    "With that, he’s back into the bathroom."

    voice "voice/5-after_passion/076.opus"
    w "Yeah…"

    "Nate looks to the side, sullenly."

    "He probably feels guilty for something he shouldn't."

    "Having Zephyr come into the apartment, having Nic move in which brought Zephyr here…"

    "Nate beats himself up over things like that sometimes, but I don't know that that's what is wrong."

    "I decide to ask  and hear him out before jumping to conclusions."

    "I step closer to him."

    voice "voice/5-after_passion/077.opus"

    w "What's the matter?"

    voice "voice/5-after_passion/080.opus"
    na "Are we going to… be okay?"

    "Oh. That's what he's worried about."

    voice "voice/5-after_passion/081.opus"
    na "I don't ever want to fight with you like what just happened here."

    voice "voice/5-after_passion/082.opus"
    w "We'll be okay, Nate."

    "We have one thing going for us that Zephyr couldn't figure out."

    voice "voice/5-after_passion/083.opus"
    w "You're {i}more{/i} than enough for me."

    "That one thing makes all the difference."

    "I pull my manatee in close, and embrace him."

    "No, not my manatee. My Nate."

    "I'm realizing more and more that I don't need to be the {i}wolf{/i} of his dreams."

    voice "voice/5-after_passion/084.opus"
    w "Nate, I'm here. Your husband is here."
