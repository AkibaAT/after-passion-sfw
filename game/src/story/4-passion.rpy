    ##Bedroom BG maybe?
    "Nate and I are lying in bed, about a foot apart."

    "It's been about two and a half hours since we both helped Nic to bed."

    "Nate wiped the puke from his face with a washcloth, then I carried him to his bedroom."

    "Nic didn't fuss much, and in his state he fell asleep pretty quickly."

    "Nate and I left his door cracked open a bit as well as our own just in case he ended up needing us."

    "..."

    "I want everything to go back to normal."

    "Nate got in bed and immediately turned away from me."

    "I thought our talk would have helped, but this is the same thing he's been doing for a few months now."

    "I miss him. He's so close, yet so far."

    "It might be a bit selfish, but I haven't gotten a really good night's sleep in so long."

    "I want to pull him in close, just hold him tight."

    "I know it will take time, but I need to feel him against me."

    "…"

    ##shuffling sound

    "I hear something outside the room, and listen carefully."

    ##shuffling, low door slide

    "A sniffle, and some shuffling."

    "The sound of the balcony door sliding open."

    w "Nate…"

    "He stirs in his sleep and turns toward me."

    "Thankfully, he's a light sleeper."

    na "Hmm? What happened?"

    w "I think Nic is up. I heard sniffling."

    "He sighs and gets up from bed."

    na "Well, I should go check on him."

    "I turn to get out of bed myself."

    na "You're coming with?"

    w "Of course, it's your cousin!"

    "He looks away, and smiles."

    na "You meant it when you said \"we\" were taking care of him, huh?"

    "I nod and put my hands on his shoulder, locking eyes with him."

    w "Yes, I do."

    w "This is important to you, and that means it's important to me."

    na "Wolfrick, you don't need to worry about my causes…"

    "I sigh and caress his cheek."

    w "Even if it's {i}your{/i} cause, I want to help because I care about you!"

    w "There's nothing I'd rather do than support you, even in the middle of the night!"

    "...and I won't be able to sleep without him anyway."

    "He smiles, and holds my hand against his cheek."

    "He nods to me and we walk off to find Nic."

    ##Balcony night BG 

    "We find him on the balcony, wrapped in a blanket and eyes wet with tears."

    na "Nic, sweetie~ oh, no."

    "Nate moves to hug Nic."

    "I move to the other side of him and rub his shoulder to soothe him."

    ni "Why is it so hard for him to just love me?!"

    "His voice is shaky and strained."

    "He doesn't sound drunk anymore, but now…"

    ni "I did everything and {i}gave{/i} everything I could for him!"

    ni "You would think it would be enough for {i}anybody{/i}, but with him {i}nothing{/i} will {i}{b}ever{/b}{/i} be enough!"

    "Nic sobs onto Nate's shoulder."

    "A moment passes and it seems like Nate can't think of something to say."

    "I decide to give him a nudge."

    w "Zephyr brings out the worst in {i}everybody{/i}."

    na "Wolfri–"

    "I hold my hand up for Nate to wait, and when our eyes meet, I make a pleading expression."

    "I need to say what I have to say."

    "Nate nods and turns back to Nic."

    ni "Don't I know it…"

    w "But not you, Nic. Not you, ever."

    ni "Wha–"

    "He gasps and I see his eyes move to meet mine."

    "His tears break free from his eyelids and drip onto Nate's shoulder."

    w "I mean it, you really were always a bright, happy ray of sunshine any time we ever saw you two together."

    w "If there's one thing I know about you, it's that you never let others get you down."

    w "That's the thing I always think about whenever Nate brings you up. It's inspiring, really."

    "Nate looks to me as Nic seems to be processing and thinking about what my meaning might be."

    "Nate nods as he seems to catch on."

    "I used a similar speech when we overthrew former High King Emperor Rexford, this one is just turned around to be positive."

    "I nod to Nate for him to take the reins."

    "He smiles at me."

    na "Yeah, Nic. He's right."

    na "After everything he's done, and after all of the things he put you through, you stayed positive and joyful!"

    na "That's something I always think about."

    na "Whenever I'm having a bad day, or whenever someone hurts me, I remember how positive your outlook on everything is!"

    na "Nic."

    "Nic wipes his tears and looks at Nate."

    ni "Y-yes?"

    na "The best thing about you brings out the best in others {i}so often{/i} that it starts to become the best part in them–"

    "Nate hugs Nic."

    na "You're worth so much to so many people – us for example!"

    na "You're more than enough for Wolfrick and me."

    na "If you aren't enough for him, then he doesn't deserve you!"

    "Nic is sniffling but he nods."

    ni "Thank you, both of you."

    "We stay on the balcony with him for a while and eventually, we move inside."

    "Nic gets ready to sleep again, putting on a chunky pair of headphones and plugging it into his walkman."

    "I told him he could borrow any of my CDs."

    "Nate and I are holding hands as we head back to the room, and before long we hear Nic's snoring coming from the other room."

    "I turn to Nate in bed."

    "He's lying facing me. He's a half-foot away."

    "I see it in his eyes again."

    "That look of passion that I've come to love."
